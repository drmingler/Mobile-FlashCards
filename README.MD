## Would-You-Rather
A mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks". Users can add flashcards to the decks they created. Each flashcard has a question and an answer to that question. A deck can have more than one flashcard. Users can take  a quiz on each deck. This App was built as part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Start
This App has been tested on both Android and iOS.

###Requirements
Make sure you have Git and Node installed, before you proceed.

#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine
To clone and run this application, you will need Git installed on your computer.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/drmingler/Mobile-FlashCards.git
```
#### 2. Run "npm install" in your local repository's folder
To install dependencies, from within the project directory:
```
Run $ npm install or $ yarn install
```
#### 3. Start the app
To  run the application with expo:
```
$ yarn global add expo-cli
$ yarn
$ expo start
```
The expo start command starts the Expo CLI server. You can now run the project on your phone by using the Expo app.

#### Android
Install the Expo app on your Android device.
Scan the QR code in your terminal from the Expo app to run the project on your phone.
Alternatively you can press 's' in the terminal and sign in with an Expo account, and sign in with the same account in the Expo app: your projects will automatically appear in the "Projects" tab.
#### iOS
Install the Expo app on your iOS device.
Press 'e' in the terminal to send the app link to your email address or phone number. This link can be used to run your project from the Expo app.
This is what the app should look like, once you open the app on Expor.
